# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Caller can manage refuels, repairs, and tickets
The system SHALL document caller-scoped collection, create, retrieve, update, and delete operations for refuels, repairs, and tickets. Refuels SHALL include date-time, station, an optional odometer reading, fuel subtype, litres, amount, and the derived per-litre price; repairs and tickets SHALL include their legacy parity fields. Refuel fuel subtype SHALL accept only `normal`, `special`, and `other`; repair type SHALL accept only `check`, `service`, `wearing_part`, and `crash_repair`; ticket type SHALL accept only `parking`, `velocity`, and `other`. Refuel litres MUST be greater than zero. Updates SHALL apply every supplied valid field, including `0`, `false`, and empty optional text, rather than ignoring falsy values. `RefuelInput`, `RefuelUpdate`, `RepairInput`, and `RepairUpdate` SHALL reject request members outside their documented properties with `400` and the common validation error representation identifying the offending member. The refuel collection SHALL return an explicit cursor page ordered by date then ID, and its station suggestion operation SHALL have its own operation identifier and string-array response.

#### Scenario: Caller updates an amount to zero
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller patches an owned expense amount to `0`
- **THEN** the response contains the updated amount of `0`

#### Scenario: Caller creates an expense for an owned car
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller submits a valid expense creation request for an owned car
- **THEN** the response is `201` with that expense linked to the requested car

#### Scenario: Caller omits an odometer reading
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller submits a valid expense without an odometer reading
- **THEN** the response represents the expense with an absent odometer reading

#### Scenario: Caller supplies an unsupported expense category
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller submits or updates an expense with a category value outside its documented codes
- **THEN** the response is `400` with the common validation error representation

#### Scenario: Caller supplies zero litres
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller creates or updates a refuel with `liters` equal to zero
- **THEN** the response is `400` with `fields.liters` set to `non_positive`

#### Scenario: Caller supplies an undocumented refuel field
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller submits a refuel creation or update request with an undocumented member
- **THEN** the response is `400` identifying that member, and no refuel is created or changed

#### Scenario: Caller supplies an undocumented repair field
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller submits a repair creation or update request with a member outside `RepairInput`/`RepairUpdate`'s documented properties
- **THEN** the response is `400` with the common validation error representation identifying that member, and no repair is created or changed
