# Legacy Parity Checklist

This file is the acceptance criterion for parity with the legacy app for
every rewrite slice (`api-contract-v1`, `db-schema-v1`,
`auth-oidc-magic-link`, each feature vertical, ...). If a piece of legacy
behaviour is not listed below and not listed in [Non-goals](#non-goals), it
is not yet a decided parity requirement — cite the item you're implementing
by id, or open a proposal to add a missing one.

Derived from `old/` (the read-only legacy Next.js app, see `AGENTS.md`) at
legacy commit `774a37f`. `old/` will be deleted once the rewrite lands; this
document is what survives it.

## Id conventions

- `SCR-nn` — a screen (page) in the legacy frontend.
- `EP-nn` — a method-and-path pair served by a legacy API handler.
- `DRV-nn` — a value the legacy app computes rather than stores.
- `NG-nn` — a non-goal: something in `old/` that is deliberately not a
  parity requirement, with the reason why.

Numbers are assigned once per prefix and never reused, so a citation
("covers `EP-12`, `EP-13`") stays valid as items are added. Later proposals
and tasks should cite ids rather than restating the items below.

## Screens

- **SCR-01** — `/` (`old/pages/index.tsx`). Public landing page. Shows a
  welcome message and four feature cards (Expenses, Refuels, Repairs,
  Tickets); each links to `/home`, `/refuels`, `/repairs`, `/tickets` when
  logged in, or to `/auth/login` otherwise. Links to login and register.
- **SCR-02** — `/home` (`old/pages/home.tsx`). Authenticated dashboard.
  Shows a car-cards summary, buttons to add a new refuel/repair/ticket, and
  an overall-expenses stacked bar chart (fed by `EP-28`) or a "no expenses"
  message if the caller has none.
- **SCR-03** — `/profile` (`old/pages/profile.tsx`). Shows a form to edit
  the caller's own user info (email, firstname, lastname; backed by
  `EP-34`/`EP-35`) and a read-only dump of the decoded JWT's claims
  (`iat`/`exp` formatted as dates).
- **SCR-04** — `/auth/login` (`old/pages/auth/login.tsx`). Email + password
  login form (`EP-01`).
- **SCR-05** — `/auth/register` (`old/pages/auth/register.tsx`). Email +
  password registration form (`EP-03`).
- **SCR-06** — `/auth/passwordForgotten`
  (`old/pages/auth/passwordForgotten.tsx`). Email input that requests a
  password-reset link (`EP-04`); links to register.
- **SCR-07** — `/auth/passwordReset/[userId]/[specialToken]`
  (`old/pages/auth/passwordReset/[[...params]].tsx`). New-password form;
  submits `userId`, `specialToken` (from the URL) and the new password to
  `EP-05`.
- **SCR-08** — `/auth/mailVerification/[userId]/[specialToken]`
  (`old/pages/auth/mailVerification/[[...params]].tsx`). No form — on
  mount, POSTs `userId`/`specialToken` (from the URL) to `EP-06` and shows
  the resulting status message.
- **SCR-09** — `/cars` (`old/pages/cars/index.tsx`). List of the caller's
  cars (`EP-07`), columns minus `isActive`/`fin`/`purchaseDate`; link to add
  a new car; each row links to the car's detail and edit screens.
- **SCR-10** — `/cars/create` (`old/pages/cars/create.tsx`). Add-car form
  (type, make, name, fuel, first registration, license plate, FIN, purchase
  date, purchase price); submits to `EP-08`.
- **SCR-11** — `/cars/[carId]` (`old/pages/cars/[carId]/index.tsx`). Car
  detail with three tabs: **Details** (all car fields, `DataList`),
  **Expenses** (the car's refuels/repairs/tickets as tables — `EP-12`,
  `EP-14`, `EP-16` — filtered to a date range that defaults to the last 6
  months, each with an "add new" shortcut), and **Consumption** (a line
  chart of `DRV-03` over the car's refuel list). "Edit Car" button links to
  `SCR-12`.
- **SCR-12** — `/cars/[carId]/edit` (`old/pages/cars/[carId]/edit.tsx`).
  Edit-car form (same fields as `SCR-10`, submits to `EP-10`) plus a
  two-step-confirm delete-car button (`EP-11`).
- **SCR-13** — `/refuels` (`old/pages/refuels/index.tsx`). A fuel-price line
  chart (`DRV-01` over time, one line per base+sub fuel type) above the list
  of all the caller's refuels (`EP-18`), with a client-side car filter built
  from the cars present in the already-loaded list and a running sum
  (`AmountSum`) of the currently-shown rows' `amount`; each row links to
  `SCR-15`; link to add a new refuel.
- **SCR-14** — `/refuels/create` (`old/pages/refuels/create.tsx`). Add-refuel
  form (car, date/time, station — autocomplete from `EP-22` — odometer
  reading, fuel subtype, liter, amount); submits to `EP-13`; accepts an
  optional `?carId=` to preselect the car.
- **SCR-15** — `/refuels/[refuelId]/edit`
  (`old/pages/refuels/[refuelId]/edit.tsx`). Edit-refuel form (same fields
  as `SCR-14`, car fixed/disabled, submits to `EP-20`) plus a
  two-step-confirm delete-refuel button (`EP-21`).
- **SCR-16** — `/repairs` (`old/pages/repairs/index.tsx`). List of all the
  caller's repairs (`EP-23`) with an `AmountSum` of the currently-shown
  rows; each row links to `SCR-18`; link to add a new repair.
- **SCR-17** — `/repairs/create` (`old/pages/repairs/create.tsx`). Add-repair
  form (car, date, station — autocomplete from `EP-27` — odometer reading,
  type, amount, description); submits to `EP-15`; accepts an optional
  `?carId=`.
- **SCR-18** — `/repairs/[repairId]/edit`
  (`old/pages/repairs/[repairId]/edit.tsx`). Edit-repair form (submits to
  `EP-25`) plus a two-step-confirm delete-repair button (`EP-26`).
- **SCR-19** — `/tickets` (`old/pages/tickets/index.tsx`). List of all the
  caller's tickets (`EP-29`) with an `AmountSum` of the currently-shown
  rows; each row links to `SCR-21`; link to add a new ticket.
- **SCR-20** — `/tickets/create` (`old/pages/tickets/create.tsx`). Add-ticket
  form (car, date, type, location — autocomplete from `EP-33` — amount,
  description); submits to `EP-17`; accepts an optional `?carId=`.
- **SCR-21** — `/tickets/[ticketId]/edit`
  (`old/pages/tickets/[ticketId]/edit.tsx`). Edit-ticket form (submits to
  `EP-31`) plus a two-step-confirm delete-ticket button (`EP-32`).

## Endpoints

All authenticated endpoints require a `Bearer` JWT access token in the
`Authorization` header, verified by `isAuthorizedOrResponse` /
`isAuthorizedForUserOrResponse` (`old/lib/backend/middleware/auth.ts`).
"Scoping" below means what restricts which rows a caller can see or act on.

- **EP-01** — `POST /api/v1/auth/login` (`old/pages/api/v1/auth/login.ts`).
  No auth. Looks up the user by email; requires `isVerified` and a matching
  `hashedPassword`; returns a new access + refresh token pair. No sort order
  (single record).
- **EP-02** — `POST /api/v1/auth/refreshToken`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/auth/refreshToken.ts`). No `Authorization` header;
  instead authorizes via the request body's `refreshToken` matched against
  a stored `RefreshToken` row whose `UserId` equals the body's `userId` and
  whose `validUntil` hasn't passed. No sort order (single record, then
  destroyed and replaced).
- **EP-03** — `POST /api/v1/auth/register`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/auth/register.ts`). No auth. Creates a user; if
  verification mail is enabled, sets `specialToken` (a new UUID) and
  `isVerified: false` and emails the token, otherwise creates the user
  already verified.
- **EP-04** — `POST /api/v1/auth/requestPasswordResetLink`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/auth/requestPasswordResetLink.ts`). No auth. Looks up
  the user by email, issues a new `specialToken` (UUID), emails a reset
  link.
- **EP-05** — `POST /api/v1/auth/resetPassword`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/auth/resetPassword.ts`). No `Authorization` header;
  authorized instead by the body's `specialToken` matching
  `user.specialToken` for the body's `userId`. On success clears
  `specialToken`, sets `isVerified: true`, sets the new hashed password.
- **EP-06** — `POST /api/v1/auth/verifyMail`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/auth/verifyMail.ts`). Same `specialToken`-in-body
  pattern as `EP-05`, scoped to the body's `userId`. On success clears
  `specialToken` and sets `isVerified: true`.
- **EP-07** — `GET /api/v1/cars` (`old/pages/api/v1/cars/index.ts`). Auth
  required. Scoped via `user.getCars()` — only the caller's own cars. No
  explicit sort order (Sequelize default).
- **EP-08** — `POST /api/v1/cars` (`old/pages/api/v1/cars/index.ts`). Auth
  required. Creates a car owned by the caller (`user.createCar(...)`).
- **EP-09** — `GET /api/v1/cars/{carId}` (`old/pages/api/v1/cars/[carId]/index.ts`).
  Auth required, scoped by `isUserAuthorizedForCarOrResponse` (403 if
  `car.UserId !== caller.id`). Single record, no sort order.
- **EP-10** — `PUT /api/v1/cars/{carId}`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/cars/[carId]/index.ts`). Same auth + scoping (checked
  twice: once before the handler branches, once again inside
  `handleUpdate`). Partial update — a field is only overwritten if its new
  value is truthy, so `""`, `0` and `false` are silently ignored.
- **EP-11** — `DELETE /api/v1/cars/{carId}`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/cars/[carId]/index.ts`). Same auth + scoping. Hard
  delete; the database cascades the delete to the car's refuels, repairs
  and tickets (`onDelete: "cascade"` in `old/db/migrations/20230115205539-create-refuel.js`,
  `...205846-create-repair.js`, `...210035-create-ticket.js`).
- **EP-12** — `GET /api/v1/cars/{carId}/refuels`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/cars/[carId]/refuels.ts`). Auth required, scoped by
  car ownership. Sort: `date ASC`.
- **EP-13** — `POST /api/v1/cars/{carId}/refuels`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/cars/[carId]/refuels.ts`). Same auth + scoping.
  Creates a refuel under that car.
- **EP-14** — `GET /api/v1/cars/{carId}/repairs`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/cars/[carId]/repairs.ts`). Auth required, scoped by
  car ownership. Sort: `date ASC`.
- **EP-15** — `POST /api/v1/cars/{carId}/repairs`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/cars/[carId]/repairs.ts`). Same auth + scoping.
  Creates a repair under that car.
- **EP-16** — `GET /api/v1/cars/{carId}/tickets`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/cars/[carId]/tickets.ts`). Auth required, scoped by
  car ownership. Sort: `date ASC`.
- **EP-17** — `POST /api/v1/cars/{carId}/tickets`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/cars/[carId]/tickets.ts`). Same auth + scoping.
  Creates a ticket under that car.
- **EP-18** — `GET /api/v1/refuels` (`old/pages/api/v1/refuels/index.ts`).
  Auth required. Scoped via an inner join on `Car` with `Car.UserId =
  caller.id`. Sort: `date ASC`. Returns every refuel across all of the
  caller's cars, unpaged.
- **EP-19** — `GET /api/v1/refuels/{refuelId}`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/refuels/[refuelId].ts`). Auth required. Looked up by
  primary key with no user filter in the query itself, then scoped
  after the fact via `isUserAuthorizedForCarOrResponse(refuel.CarId)` — 403
  if the refuel's car belongs to another user.
- **EP-20** — `PUT /api/v1/refuels/{refuelId}`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/refuels/[refuelId].ts`). Same lookup + scoping as
  `EP-19`. Partial update; falsy values ignored (same pattern as `EP-10`).
- **EP-21** — `DELETE /api/v1/refuels/{refuelId}`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/refuels/[refuelId].ts`). Same lookup + scoping as
  `EP-19`. Hard delete.
- **EP-22** — `GET /api/v1/refuels/stations`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/refuels/stations.ts`). Auth required (any
  authenticated user), but the query is **not** scoped to the caller —
  `Refuel.findAll({ attributes: ["station"] })` reads every user's station
  names. Sort: `station ASC`. See `NG-03`.
- **EP-23** — `GET /api/v1/repairs` (`old/pages/api/v1/repairs/index.ts`).
  Same pattern as `EP-18` for repairs. Sort: `date ASC`.
- **EP-24** — `GET /api/v1/repairs/{repairId}`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/repairs/[repairId].ts`). Same pattern as `EP-19` for
  repairs.
- **EP-25** — `PUT /api/v1/repairs/{repairId}`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/repairs/[repairId].ts`). Same pattern as `EP-20` for
  repairs.
- **EP-26** — `DELETE /api/v1/repairs/{repairId}`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/repairs/[repairId].ts`). Same pattern as `EP-21` for
  repairs.
- **EP-27** — `GET /api/v1/repairs/stations`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/repairs/stations.ts`). Same as `EP-22`, unscoped
  across users. Sort: `station ASC`. See `NG-03`.
- **EP-28** — `GET /api/v1/stats/expenses`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/stats/expenses.ts`). Auth required. Scoped to the
  caller's cars via join. Optional `from`/`to` query params (`date >=
  from`, `date < to`). Returns `{ refuels, repairs, tickets }`, each an
  array of `{ id, date, amount, CarId }`. Sort: `date ASC` per list.
- **EP-29** — `GET /api/v1/tickets` (`old/pages/api/v1/tickets/index.ts`).
  Same pattern as `EP-18`/`EP-23` for tickets. Sort: `date ASC`.
- **EP-30** — `GET /api/v1/tickets/{ticketId}`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/tickets/[ticketId].ts`). Same pattern as `EP-19`/`EP-24`
  for tickets.
- **EP-31** — `PUT /api/v1/tickets/{ticketId}`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/tickets/[ticketId].ts`). Same pattern as `EP-20`/`EP-25`
  for tickets.
- **EP-32** — `DELETE /api/v1/tickets/{ticketId}`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/tickets/[ticketId].ts`). Same pattern as
  `EP-21`/`EP-26` for tickets.
- **EP-33** — `GET /api/v1/tickets/locations`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/tickets/locations.ts`). Same as `EP-22`/`EP-27`,
  unscoped across users. Sort: `location ASC`. See `NG-03`.
- **EP-34** — `GET /api/v1/users/{userId}`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/users/[userId].ts`). Auth required, scoped by
  `isAuthorizedForUserOrResponse` — 401 unless the token's own id equals the
  path `userId`. Returns `{ id, email, firstname, lastname }`.
- **EP-35** — `PUT /api/v1/users/{userId}`
  (`old/pages/api/v1/users/[userId].ts`). Same auth + scoping as `EP-34`.
  Rejects if the new email is already taken by another user; updates
  email/firstname/lastname.

## Derived values

All three are computed client-side in
`old/hooks/fetch/use-refuels-backend.ts`, over a refuel list fetched in
`date ASC` order (`EP-18`/`EP-12`).

- **DRV-01** — `perLiter`. Formula (in `refuelToFrontendRefuel`):
  `Math.round((1000 * refuel.amount) / refuel.liter) / 1000` — 3 decimal
  places. Computed for every refuel row. Displayed as the "per liter" column
  on `/refuels` (`SCR-13`) and used as the Y value of the fuel-price chart on
  `/refuels` (`SCR-13`).
- **DRV-02** — `distance`. Formula (in `refuelListToFrontendRefuelList`):
  walking the list in fetched order, keeping a running map of the previous
  `odometerReading` seen per `CarId`: `distance = odometerReading -
  previousOdometerReadingForThisCar`. Only set once a previous reading
  exists for that car — the first refuel of each car has no `distance`. Not
  displayed directly; feeds `DRV-03`.
- **DRV-03** — `consumption`. Formula: `Math.round((10000 * liter) /
  distance) / 100` — 2 decimal places — only computed when `DRV-02`'s
  `distance` is available for that row. Displayed as the "Consumption"
  column wherever `RefuelList` renders it (`/refuels` `SCR-13`, and the
  Expenses tab of `/cars/[carId]` `SCR-11`), and is the Y value of the
  consumption chart on the Consumption tab of `/cars/[carId]` (`SCR-11`).

### Flagged for `api-contract-v1`

Recorded, not resolved — each is a contract-shaped question that
`api-contract-v1` owns.

1. **Derived refuel fields losing their predecessor across a page
   boundary.** `DRV-02`/`DRV-03` are computed by walking the *whole*
   date-ascending refuel list per car, keeping the previous odometer
   reading in memory. Under cursor pagination, a client holding only the
   current page no longer has the predecessor row once it's past the first
   page, so the first row of every later page would render without a
   `distance`/`consumption` value. Affects `DRV-02`, `DRV-03`, `SCR-13`,
   `SCR-11`. Open question: where does this move — server-side storage,
   a "previous odometer" value returned alongside each page, or something
   else?
2. **Client-side car filter seeing only the loaded page.** `/refuels`
   (`SCR-13`), `/repairs` (`SCR-16`) and `/tickets` (`SCR-19`) build their
   car filter (`ButtonSelect`) from the cars present in the
   already-fetched list (e.g. `refuelListToCarFilterList` in
   `old/pages/refuels/index.tsx`), then filter client-side. Under cursor
   pagination the filter would only ever see cars present in the current
   page. Affects `SCR-13`, `SCR-16`, `SCR-19`. Open question: does
   filtering become a server-side query parameter instead of a client-side
   list filter?
3. **Charts fed the same truncated array as the list.** The fuel-price
   chart (`SCR-13`) and consumption chart (`SCR-11`) are fed the exact same
   list the table renders; the overall-expenses chart on `/home` (`SCR-02`)
   is fed by `EP-28`, itself unpaged today. Paging any of these lists would
   silently truncate the corresponding chart's data. Affects `DRV-01`,
   `SCR-13`, `SCR-11`, `SCR-02`, `EP-28`. Open question: do charts get
   their own unpaged/aggregated endpoint, or does the frontend accumulate
   pages before charting?

## Non-goals

Restated from the Scope decisions table (outside this repository) as a
closed list — each of these is deliberately *not* a parity requirement, with
the reason why.

- **NG-01** — Password login. The legacy app supports email + password
  login (`User.hashedPassword`, `EP-01`). The rewrite's target architecture
  is OIDC + magic link only (`openspec/config.yaml`); password login is
  replaced, not ported.
- **NG-02** — `specialToken`. A single-use UUID stored on `User.specialToken`,
  reused for both password-reset (`EP-05`) and mail-verification (`EP-06`)
  links, compared server-side and cleared after use. Replaced entirely by
  the rewrite's magic-link flow — there's no separate mechanism to port.
- **NG-03** — Unscoped suggestion endpoints. `EP-22`, `EP-27` and `EP-33`
  require auth but return every user's station/location values, not just
  the caller's. This is a scoping bug in the legacy app, not intended
  behaviour — parity is the autocomplete *feature*, not the cross-user data
  leak.
- **NG-04** — Reminders. Mentioned only in old product copy (already
  removed from `README.md` by `bootstrap-build`); no reminder model,
  endpoint, or screen exists anywhere in `old/`. Never built in the legacy
  app, so there is nothing to port.
- **NG-05** — Unpaged lists. Every list-returning endpoint (`EP-07`,
  `EP-18`, `EP-23`, `EP-28`, `EP-29`) returns its entire result set with no
  pagination. The rewrite adopts cursor pagination (`api-contract-v1`);
  parity is about the data and ordering returned, not the absence of
  paging — the tension this creates is the subject of the three flagged
  conflicts above, not this non-goal.
- **NG-06** — Tokens in `localStorage`. The legacy frontend stores the JWT
  access and refresh tokens in `localStorage`
  (`old/lib/frontend/userService.ts`). The target architecture explicitly
  forbids storing tokens/sessions in browser localStorage (`AGENTS.md`);
  the new backend-issued session mechanism replaces this.
