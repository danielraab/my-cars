# api-contract/expenses Specification

## Purpose

Defines caller-scoped expense records, autocomplete data, and complete chart data that preserve legacy expense and consumption behaviour under pagination.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Caller can manage refuels, repairs, and tickets
The system SHALL document caller-scoped collection, create, retrieve, update, and delete operations for refuels, repairs, and tickets. Refuels SHALL include date-time, station, an optional odometer reading, fuel subtype, litres, amount, and the derived per-litre price; repairs and tickets SHALL include their legacy parity fields. Refuel fuel subtype SHALL accept only `normal`, `special`, and `other`; repair type SHALL accept only `check`, `service`, `wearing_part`, and `crash_repair`; ticket type SHALL accept only `parking`, `velocity`, and `other`. Refuel litres MUST be greater than zero. Updates SHALL apply every supplied valid field, including `0`, `false`, and empty optional text, rather than ignoring falsy values. `RefuelInput`, `RefuelUpdate`, `RepairInput`, `RepairUpdate`, `TicketInput`, and `TicketUpdate` SHALL reject request members outside their documented properties with `400` and the common validation error representation identifying the offending member. The refuel and ticket collections SHALL each return an explicit cursor page ordered by date then ID. The refuel station suggestion operation and the ticket location suggestion operation SHALL each have their own operation identifier and a string-array response. A ticket representation SHALL always contain every documented member, with an empty description when none was recorded.

#### Scenario: Caller updates an amount to zero
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller patches an owned expense amount to `0`
- **THEN** the response contains the updated amount of `0`

#### Scenario: Caller creates an expense for an owned car
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller submits a valid expense creation request for an owned car
- **THEN** the response is `201` with that expense linked to the requested car

#### Scenario: Caller omits an odometer reading
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller submits a valid expense without an odometer reading
- **THEN** the response represents the expense with an absent odometer reading

#### Scenario: Caller supplies an unsupported expense category
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller submits or updates an expense with a category value outside its documented codes
- **THEN** the response is `400` with the common validation error representation

#### Scenario: Caller supplies zero litres
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller creates or updates a refuel with `liters` equal to zero
- **THEN** the response is `400` with `fields.liters` set to `non_positive`

#### Scenario: Caller supplies an undocumented refuel field
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller submits a refuel creation or update request with an undocumented member
- **THEN** the response is `400` identifying that member, and no refuel is created or changed

#### Scenario: Caller supplies an undocumented repair field
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller submits a repair creation or update request with a member outside `RepairInput`/`RepairUpdate`'s documented properties
- **THEN** the response is `400` with the common validation error representation identifying that member, and no repair is created or changed

#### Scenario: Caller supplies an undocumented ticket field
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller submits a ticket creation or update request with a member outside `TicketInput`/`TicketUpdate`'s documented properties
- **THEN** the response is `400` with the common validation error representation identifying that member, and no ticket is created or changed

#### Scenario: Caller pages through tickets
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller lists tickets and the response carries a non-null `nextCursor`
- **THEN** requesting the collection with that cursor returns the following tickets in date-then-ID order, and the last page carries a `null` `nextCursor`

#### Scenario: Caller clears a ticket description
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller patches an owned ticket's `description` to the empty string
- **THEN** the response contains the ticket with an empty `description`, and every other member unchanged

### Requirement: Suggestions are restricted to the caller's data
The system SHALL document station and ticket-location suggestion operations whose results are drawn only from the authenticated caller's expense records, are distinct values, and are ordered lexically.

#### Scenario: Caller requests station suggestions
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller requests station suggestions
- **THEN** the response contains no station value contributed solely by another account

### Requirement: Refuel data required for consumption and price charts is complete
The system SHALL document a chart-oriented refuel query, separately from the paginated table collection, that returns all matching caller-owned refuels in date order with server-computed `perLiter`, `distance`, and `consumption`. `distance` and `consumption` SHALL be absent only for a car's first applicable refuel, not because a table page begins after its predecessor, and not because the predecessor lies before the query's `from` bound.

#### Scenario: Refuel follows a prior page boundary
- **WHEN** a chart query includes a refuel whose predecessor is outside a table page
- **THEN** that refuel's distance and consumption are computed from its actual prior refuel for the same car

#### Scenario: Refuel's predecessor lies before the requested range
- **WHEN** a chart query with a `from` bound includes a car's first refuel on or after `from`, and that car has an earlier refuel with an odometer reading before `from`
- **THEN** the response contains only refuels within the range, and that first refuel's distance and consumption are computed from the earlier refuel's odometer reading

#### Scenario: Car's first refuel ever
- **WHEN** a chart query includes a car's earliest refuel with an odometer reading
- **THEN** that refuel has no distance and no consumption

### Requirement: Dashboard expense data is bounded by an instant range
The system SHALL document an expense-statistics query that requires a `from` and a `to` date-time and accepts an optional caller-owned car filter. `from` SHALL be inclusive and `to` exclusive, the same as the expense collections' range. The response SHALL contain every refuel, repair and ticket of the caller's cars dated within the range, each as a row with its date-time, its kind (`refuel`, `repair` or `ticket`) and its amount, ordered by date, in a single unpaged response. The response SHALL NOT group rows into days or other calendar buckets, because only the client knows the viewer's time zone. A missing or malformed `from` or `to`, or a malformed car filter, SHALL be rejected with `400` and the common validation error representation identifying the parameter. A car filter naming a car the caller does not own SHALL return no rows.

#### Scenario: Caller requests a year of expenses
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller requests statistics with `from` and `to` bounding one year
- **THEN** the response contains a row for each of that caller's refuels, repairs and tickets dated on or after `from` and before `to`, ordered by date, with its kind and amount

#### Scenario: Expense at the range boundary
- **WHEN** an expense is dated exactly at `to`
- **THEN** it is not in the response, and an expense dated exactly at `from` is

#### Scenario: Caller filters by car
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller requests statistics with the ID of one of their cars
- **THEN** the response contains only that car's expenses within the range

#### Scenario: Caller filters by another account's car
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller requests statistics with the ID of a car they do not own
- **THEN** the response is `200` with no rows

#### Scenario: Caller omits the range
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller requests statistics without `from` or without `to`
- **THEN** the response is `400` with the common validation error representation identifying the missing parameter

#### Scenario: Another account's expenses are excluded
- **WHEN** another account has expenses within the requested range
- **THEN** none of them appear in the caller's response
