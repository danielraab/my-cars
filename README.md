# my-car

A car management app — vehicles, refuels, repairs, and traffic tickets in
one place. This repository is a ground-up **rewrite** of a legacy Next.js
full-stack app; the legacy code lives, untouched, in [`old/`](old) purely
as reference and will be deleted once the rewrite is complete.

## Status

🚧 **Active rewrite, not yet usable in production.** Architecture and
scope are being defined via [OpenSpec](openspec/) change proposals before
implementation. See [`openspec/changes/`](openspec/changes) for what's
currently in flight.

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────┐        REST API        ┌───────────────────────────┐
│   frontend/ (React)     │  ─────────────────────▶ │      backend/ (Go)        │
│   static build only     │  ◀───────────────────── │  REST API + auth + data   │
│   TanStack Router,      │     documented via       │  serves frontend's static │
│   Tailwind, HeadlessUI  │     OpenAPI spec         │  build output in prod     │
└─────────────────────────┘                          └───────────────────────────┘
```

- **Backend** (`backend/`) — Go. Owns the REST API, authentication, and
  business data. In production it also serves the frontend's compiled
  static assets — there is no separate Node server at runtime.
- **Frontend** (`frontend/`) — React, built to static files only (no SSR).
  Talks to the backend exclusively over the REST API described in the
  OpenAPI spec.
- **API contract** — every endpoint is documented in an OpenAPI
  specification, which is the source of truth for request/response
  shapes. Contract changes are reviewed like code.
- **Authentication** — handled entirely by the backend. Two login
  methods are supported, **OIDC** and **magic link** (passwordless
  email); if both resolve to the same email address they log into the
  same account. Sessions/tokens are never stored in browser
  `localStorage`.
- **Internationalization** — the frontend ships with **German (de)** and
  **English (en)** at all times; every user-facing string needs both.

## Tech stack

| Layer     | Choices |
|-----------|---------|
| Backend   | Go |
| Frontend  | React, Vite, TanStack Router, Tailwind CSS, HeadlessUI, lucide-react |
| Package manager (frontend) | pnpm |
| API       | REST, documented with OpenAPI |
| Auth      | OIDC + magic link, backend-issued sessions (no localStorage tokens) |
| Process   | [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) spec-driven development |

## Getting started

> The backend and frontend are early scaffolding; commands below will
> expand as the rewrite progresses.

**Backend**
```bash
cd backend
go run .
```

**Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Development workflow

This project follows **spec-driven development with [OpenSpec](openspec/)**.
Any non-trivial change — a new feature, endpoint, schema change, or
architectural decision — goes through:

1. **Explore** — think through the problem, investigate the existing
   code, and clarify requirements.
2. **Propose** — capture the decision as a change under
   `openspec/changes/` (proposal, design, specs, tasks).
3. **Apply** — implement against the approved proposal.

Validate the API contract locally with:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm lint:openapi
```

Small, obvious fixes are exempt. See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and
[`openspec/config.yaml`](openspec/config.yaml) for the full project
context and ground rules, including that **`old/` is strictly read-only**
and will be removed once the rewrite lands.

Parity with the legacy app is the acceptance criterion for the rewrite; see
[`docs/parity-checklist.md`](docs/parity-checklist.md) for the checkable
inventory.

## Contributing

- Follow the workflow above — start with an OpenSpec proposal for
  anything beyond a trivial fix.
- Keep the OpenAPI spec in sync with any backend endpoint change.
- Add both `de` and `en` translations for any new frontend string.
- Never modify files under `old/`.
